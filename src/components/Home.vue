      <i>My work animates questions of identity.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      <i>I value seeing the body in a spectrum from virtuosic spontaneity to blunt gestural unison. 
      My aesthetics insist on attention to revolving state-based material for example a sense of loneliness, or control, or tenderness, 
      or humor, or dissonance, or ritual, or a combination; resulting in multi-dimensional layering of physical and vocal expressivity. 
      Themes in my work comprise of collective humanity; how we exist in our mundane and extraordinary socio-cultural environments.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      <i>Identity is at the core of my values and how it unfolds defines my creative process. In my recently published article for Contact 
      Quarterly, I write: “Folks with marginalized identities are somatically and psychically guarded, from generations past and a lifetime 
      of systemic oppression;<strong> it is in the body and it will enter the dance.</strong>”</i>
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      <i>My work centers relationships. I crave an aesthetic of closeness; which allows performers to move with intimacy and risk, with each other 
      and in relationship to an audience. When we come into a moment of connection, we do it with the intention to completely engage each other, 
      without representing intimacy, we commit to being intimate. This is part of the magic, using intention, improvisation and design to create 
      new works that comment on how I perceive contemporary humanity.</i>

    <p class="text-justify">
      My practice and pedagogy are grounded in somatic practices, structures of performative improvisation, contact improvisation and everyday magic. Within a workshop or laboratory structure I’m interested in the foundational awareness of systemic power dynamics, cultural patterns of privilege, and our ability to shift toward greater equity in an embodied, co-learning space.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      I continue to be inspired to teach the fundamentals and deep research of contact improvisation with a restorative justice and consent framing. As a Diversity & Inclusion consultant and facilitator I am interested in updating community spaces, guidelines, and awareness to reflect more inclusive practices for artists with marginalized identities.
